# Mirrors everything the helm e2e pulls from an external registry into the
# platform registry, so `make helm-e2e-setup` / `helm-e2e-install` pull from
# harbor.isuanova.com instead of quay.io and Docker Hub. The runner reaches
# harbor on the internal network, and Docker Hub's anonymous pull limits are a
# CI failure this keeps clear of.
#
# Run by hand when a pinned version moves — CI only ever pulls. Pushing needs
# credentials the e2e itself does not: the project is public-read, so a node
# pulls anonymously, but this script needs `docker login harbor.isuanova.com`
# (crane reads the same config.json) or `crane auth login`.
#
# The versions are read out of the files that pin them rather than restated
# here: the same reason PERMISSION_INIT_IMAGE is read out of the controller's
# source, so a bump cannot leave this mirroring a tag nothing asks for.
#
# The upstream side goes through HTTPS_PROXY if one is set; add the registry to
# NO_PROXY so harbor is still reached directly. If your network does not need a
# proxy, set nothing.
