# Installs the upstream LeaderWorkerSet controller AND its
# leaderworkerset/disaggregatedset CRDs into the helm-e2e kind cluster from the
# pinned lws module's config/default (the chart ships only the ai.cubestack.io
# CRDs). Without the controller and its CRDs LeaderWorkerSets never materialize
# pods, so ISVC Ready is unreachable.
#
# The controller image reference in the manifests points at the upstream
# staging registry, which is unreachable from this network. Image fallback
# chain: (1) the platform registry's mirror of the release-tagged upstream
# image, (2) docker pull of the manifest image, (3) the same image via the
# docker.1ms.run mirror (retagged to the original ref), (4) a local build from
# the pinned lws go module (golang:1.26 + distroless bases are cached; the
# build uses the goproxy.cn mirror because proxy.golang.org is unreachable).
# The picked image is then loaded into kind so the kubelet runs it locally.
#
# CI stops at step 1 (GitHub Actions sets CI=true): everything past it is
# either the mutable `main` tag the note below rejects or a local build that
# costs a cold ~80s Go compile on every run to reproduce a byte-identical
# image. The mirror is pinned to the release tag for the same module version
# go.mod names, so it is the deterministic v0.10.0 build steps 2-4 were trying
# to approximate — and cheaper than all of them.
#
# Idempotent: exits early when lws-controller-manager is already Available.
